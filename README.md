# Project Overview: Secure Web Application

## Objective
Build a simple web application that demonstrates common web vulnerabilities (like SQL Injection, XSS, CSRF) and their mitigations. This application will help in understanding how these attacks work and how to defend against them.

## Technologies
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- PHP or Python (Flask/Django) for server-side scripting
- MySQL or SQLite for database

## Structure

### Home Page
- Overview of the application
- Links to different sections demonstrating various vulnerabilities

### Login Page
- Demonstrate SQL Injection
- Mitigation using prepared statements

### Comments Section
- Demonstrate Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Mitigation using input sanitization and output encoding

### User Profile
- Demonstrate Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- Mitigation using anti-CSRF tokens

### Secure Data Transmission
- Demonstrate the importance of HTTPS
- Basic explanation of SSL/TLS

### Best Practices
- General security tips
- Importance of regular updates and patches
- Secure coding practices
